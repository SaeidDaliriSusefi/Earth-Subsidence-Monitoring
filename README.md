#  Earth Subsidence Monitoring using Sentinel-1

This project provides a robust and automated workflow for monitoring ground subsidence using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Ground subsidence refers to the gradual sinking or settling of the Earth's surface, which can have serious implications for urban infrastructure, agriculture, and water management.

## üåç Overview
Using the radar interferometry technique (InSAR), this workflow enables:

Detection and visualization of subsidence over time.

Processing of Sentinel-1 SAR data for various locations.

Time-series analysis of surface displacement.

Support for both ASCENDING and DESCENDING satellite passes.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Data Source
This project utilizes freely available Sentinel-1 SAR data provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) via the Copernicus Open Access Hub.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
Preprocessing of Sentinel-1 SAR data

Interferogram generation and coherence masking

LOS (Line of Sight) displacement computation

Time-series deformation analysis

ASCENDING and DESCENDING orbit support

Export of results as maps and downloadable datasets
